# Overview

#### **What is NLP**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is utilizing computers to be able to generate and
process the English language.
There are many applications that fall under NLP such as sentiment analyzers,
chatbots, and email filters.

#### **NLP & AI**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) are both subsets of
Artificial Intelligence.
NLP is a specific focus on a computer's ability to "understand" natural language
semantics and frequently utilizes machine learning algorithms and principals.

#### **Natural Language Understanding & Natural Language Generation**

Natural Language understanding and generation go hand-in-hand in NLP.
For a good NLP model to generate cohesive text it needs to have a good
understanding of the English language and all the intricate nuances that come with it.
To have a good understanding of language it's important to be able to evaluate and
improve the models, by generating language based on the model's understanding it
allows us to understand how the model is performing and which areas of
understanding need improvement.

#### **Modern NLP Applications**

NLP is being utilized more and more as time goes on with new applications popping
up every day.
One new application is the usage of NLP in legal proceedings. The CEO of DoNotPay
announced their AI would listen to court arguments and advise defendants on what
to say (Source), the prospect of NLP models built for law, with all legal documents at
their disposal may be a major tool in legal proceedings in the future.
Another popular application of NLP that is currently being developed are chatbots or
assistants, chatGPT currently being one of the biggest. With some refinement, the
incorporation of these into search engines could provide a new major outlet on how
users access information through the internet.
NLP has also been used previously as a form of an initial interface to customer service
with limited functionality, but with the growing advancement of the sophistication of
models they could eventually take over a majority of customer service processing.

#### **3 Main Approaches to NLP**

**Rules Based:**
The first approach to NLP that was used in the 1960's is a rules based approach.
These were extremely simplistic compared to current methods, and worked by
utilizing things like regex and if then statements, basically fitting language into a set of
rules to get certain results. This was effective for very rudimentary applications such
as the chatbot ELIZA which was created in the mid 1960's at the MIT artificial
intelligence library. Because of how it worked, it had issues scaling up the the
complexity of human language and had limited functional applications.

**Statistical and Probabilistic:**
In the 1980's the statistical and probabilistic approach appeared. This worked by
using word frequencies and traditional machine learning algorithms to gauge the
intent and sentiment of text. An example of this would be sentiment analysis
programs, by taking out stop words and analyzing the words and their frequency
models can gauge how positive or negative the sentiment or even the topic of the
text. This approach needs a moderate amount of data and decent processing power,
which is less of a problem now than it was when it initially was developed.

**Deep Learning:**
Deep learning is the most recent approach and has been very successful in advancing
NLP. Deep learning works by simulating a neural network of a set amount of layers of
neurons. This has resulted in improved results in many different areas of NLP such as
generation, understanding, and translation. ChatGPT is an example of a modern NLP
program that utilizes deep learning and is one of the more sophisticated chatbots
created thus far. One problem with this approach is the vast amount of data and
processing power required.
