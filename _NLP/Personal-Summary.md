### Summary
As of now I've done numerous projects in the domain of ML/AI/NLP during my undergraduate degree. These areas are incredibly exciting and I see the future being highly driven by AI applications.
Although I'm not working in AI applications post-grad it's something that definitely interests me and I'd love to work on AI related projects sometime in the future.
I plan to continue to keep up with the progression and development of AI systems with personal projects or github contributions to relevant projects.
