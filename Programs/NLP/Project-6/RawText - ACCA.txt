		16 March 2022: As the war continues in Ukraine, ACCA has taken a number of steps including increasing support for our Ukrainian members and students, and suspending operations in Russia.
	

We continue to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and wish to see a just and peaceful end to this horrific war. Our thoughts are with our Ukraine community as they face these tragic events.
We are encouraging employers from across Poland and other European countries to post job vacancies on our ACCA Careers jobs board aimed at Ukrainian members and students forced to leave their country. We are also supporting them with information on legal and humanitarian issues, as well as CPD support for members and study support for students. We have waived our fees for the year.
The suspension in Russia also covers Belarus, and includes in-market activities, including exams. We are taking steps to manage this transition responsibly. Our members and students in Russia and Belarus continue to be part of the global ACCA community.
We have also published guidance for our members globally on managing the implications of the war, including risk management and sanctions (see related links on this page). 
We continue to follow and support government sanctions in our own operations.
Our aim remains the same at this sad and challenging time - to provide opportunity to people of ability and to develop the world’s accountancy profession, irrespective of location, and to work for the public good.
