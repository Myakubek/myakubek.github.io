Milwaukee,
Wis.—
A.
O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:
AOS), a world leader in water heating and water treatment, along with the A. O.
Smith Foundation, the company’s charitable arm, has made a $100,000 donation to
the American Red Cross to help support humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine.
With
operations across the globe, A. O. Smith believes in helping communities
through efforts that focus on health and human services.
According to
the American Red Cross website, more than two million people have fled Ukraine
to nearby countries and an estimated 18 million – one-third of the country’s
population – will need assistance.
Red Cross teams have donated food, water,
medical supplies, household items and hygiene parcels to families seeking
safety.
“Our
Foundation’s leadership agreed unanimously to offer this contribution as a
small gesture to provide basic human necessities—food, water, shelter, medical
care—to those affected,” said Kevin Wheeler, A. O. Smith chairman, president
and CEO.
“The Foundation deeply believes in giving back to our communities, and
while the company doesn’t have operations there, it is impossible not to have compassion
for those suffering in Ukraine.”
In addition to
the Foundation’s direct financial support, A. O. Smith has also partnered with
the American Red Cross to create a donation microsite to assist our employees in
making personal contributions to the relief efforts if they choose.
The A. O. Smith
Foundation is committed to making our communities a better place to live and
work by partnering with and supporting nonprofit organizations around the
world.
Established in 1955, the Foundation has provided more than $50 million
in financial support for worthwhile organizations, institutions and programs.
