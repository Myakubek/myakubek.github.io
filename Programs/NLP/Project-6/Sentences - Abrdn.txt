We want to express our deepest concern and sadness at events happening in Ukraine.
abrdn has concluded that we will not be investing in Russia or Belarus for the foreseeable future, on ESG grounds.
We have already taken action to reduce our exposure to these regions in a disciplined manner, protecting our clients’ interests.
We remain engaged investors and exercise our rights as active owners on behalf of our clients.
Where we may have indirect exposure to the region, we will ensure our voice is heard as part of our normal engagement activities to encourage the highest standard of behaviour from those entities in which we invest.
We will continue to follow developments very closely and take whatever steps are necessary in the interests of our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders in the business.
